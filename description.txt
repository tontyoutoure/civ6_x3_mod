This mod scales all traits of leaders and civilisations by 3. So every trait is 3 times stronger, bigger, and more powerfull. Guaranteed very balanced.

Because this mod alters almost every trait/unit/building in the game, it is most likely incompatible with most gameplay changing mods, UI mods and such should be fine.
